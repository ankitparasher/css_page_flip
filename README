CSS Page Flip v0.1 

This is an open source pure CSS and Javascript 3D Page Flipping framework (which requires jQuery)

It converts this:

<ol id="foo">
	<li>Page 1</li>
	<li>Page 2</li>
	<li>Page 3</li>
</ol>

Into a page flippable layout using pure CSS3 animations.

This has been tested in Webkit, both in Safari and iPhone.

Simply include all source files under lib, and (for the example above) call:

	CSSPageFlip.init('foo');
	
You can apply your own styles to each page by targeting "ol li .page". CSSPageFlip
will set the size of the flipping UI to fill the space in the containing element.

See the examples directory for more usage details.
