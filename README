CSS Page Flip v0.1 

This is an open source pure CSS and Javascript 3D Page Flipping framework (which requires Prototype).

It converts this:

<ol id="foo">
	<li>Page 1</li>
	<li>Page 2</li>
	<li>Page 3</li>
</ol>

Into a page flippable layout using pure CSS3 animations.

This has been tested in Webkit, both in Safari and iPhone.

Simply include all source files under lib, and (for the example above) call:

	new CSSPageFlip('foo');

See the examples directory for more usage details.
